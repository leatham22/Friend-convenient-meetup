# Graph v0.3 - Testing New Data Structure

## Description 

* This directory contains a script for testing or comparing a revised graph data structure. 
* Our new structure uses TFL's "Hub" system to group stations in the same complex into one node.
* As our old data structure contained all stations, our script checks that each station in old structure is within the "Hubs" of the new structure. 

## Contents

*   `compare_base_graphs.py`: Script designed to compare the newly structured graph against a previous or base version.
