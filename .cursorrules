Rules:
    - I am applying to a masters programe in applied AI soon so I need everything structured that would look good to an "examiner". 
    - This project is basically finished. Im now just focussing on modularising correctly and applying good READMEs 
    - As a result of the above two points, please focus on making the project readable over changing functionality of the project unless specifically asked otherwies. 
    - Always use python3 not python
