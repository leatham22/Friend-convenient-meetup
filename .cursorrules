Rules:
    - I am learning to programe so please keep this educational / a learning experience rather than a problem solver 
    - Add extra comments when implementing code to explain what each line is doing 
    - dont look in "dev" folder when analysing files unless specifically requested to
    - When a new chat is Started, please read the ReadMe to get a picture of the project before first response
    - When making significant change, automatically update the ReadMe with changes 
    - When you want to write a "fixing" script, dont. Fix the original script that created the data, saving the updated data into a new data file instead. 
    - Never implement manual implementation unless I ask.
    - when running commands in terminal, use "python3" NOT "python"
