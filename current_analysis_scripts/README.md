# Current Analysis Scripts

This directory contains actively maintained and currently used analysis scripts for the project.

## Active Scripts

- `analyze_location_diffs.py`: Currently used for analyzing geographical differences between station locations

## Purpose

These scripts are actively maintained and used for:
- Current analysis needs
- Active data verification
- Ongoing station location monitoring

## Usage

These scripts are part of the current workflow and should be used for:
1. Regular analysis of station data changes
2. Verification of geographical accuracy
3. Current data quality monitoring

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Access to current station data files in the `raw_stations` and `slim_stations` directories
- Up-to-date station data (sync using scripts in `local_data_scripts` first)

## Note
Unlike scripts in the `dev` directory, these scripts are actively maintained and tested with the current data structure.
