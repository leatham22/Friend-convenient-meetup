# Legacy Graph Data

This directory contains data files that were part of previous iterations of the graph generation process but are now considered outdated or have been superseded by newer methods or files.

## Purpose

To keep a record of older data artifacts for historical reference or potential debugging, without cluttering the main `graph_data` directory.

## Files

*   **`tfl_line_data.json`**: 
    *   **Description**: Raw line/route sequence data fetched directly from the TfL API (`/Line/Route/Sequence/{id}`). This was the primary input used to write/build the initial graph build (`build_networkx_graph_new.py`). While the build script still uses this if present (to avoid redundant API calls), the canonical data source is now the TfL API itself.
    *   **Status**: Legacy / Cache. Can be deleted and regenerated by `build_networkx_graph_new.py`.

*   **`weighted_edges.json`**: 
    *   **Description**: Stored journey times calculated using an older version or method of `get_journey_times.py`. The current version of `get_journey_times.py` is still used for overground, elizabeth line, and some quirky tube/dlr edges. 
    *   **Status**: Superseded by `Edge_weights_tube_dlr.json` and `Edge_weights_overground_elizabeth.json`.

*   **`old_networkx_graph_new.json` / `OG_networkx_graph.json`**: 
    *   **Description**: Previous versions of the network graph JSON file, saved as backups during development. `OG_networkx_graph.json` being the first iteration of graph implementation, `old_networkx_graph_new.json` being the second to last iteration. 
    *   **Status**: Superseded by the current `../networkx_graph_new.json`.

*   **`stations_slim_format.json`**: 
    *   **Description**: Output of an old graph creation script method, in the same format as `slim_stations/unique_stations.json`. 
    *   **Purpose at time**: At that point of the project, `slim_stations/unique_stations.json` was the master data source/validator for all potential stations a user can start/travel to. 
    *   **Status**: Once the graph data `networkx_graph_new.json` was optimised, it became the master data source and `stations_slim_format.json` was thrown away.
