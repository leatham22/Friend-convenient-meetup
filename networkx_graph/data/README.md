# Input Data

This directory contains input data used by the graph creation and analysis scripts.

## Contents

-   **`manually_created/`**: This subdirectory holds data file containing terminal stations for each line. Do not edit this file as it has been manually created to extract timetable data in `get_timetable_data.py` between terminal stations. This data is saved to `raw_API_data/timetable_cache`.


-   **`raw_API_data/`**: This subdirectory stores raw data files fetched directly from external APIs, primarily the TfL Unified API. These files serve as the basis for graph construction and weight calculation and may be cached here to avoid repeated API calls. Examples include:
    *   Line sequence data (`/Line/{id}/Route/Sequence/all`).
    *   Timetable data.
    *   Journey planning results used for weight calculations.
    *   *(Consult the files within this subdirectory for specifics)*

## Usage

Scripts in the `create_graph` and `analyse_graph` directories read data from this location. The `build_graph.py` pipeline expects certain files to exist here or will attempt to generate them (e.g., by fetching from the API and saving to `raw_API_data/`).

**Note**: Modifying files in `manually_created/` may directly impact the structure or attributes of the generated graph. Files in `raw_API_data/` are typically overwritten when the data fetching steps of the pipeline are run.
