# Graph Creation Output Files

This directory stores the intermediate and final JSON output files generated by the graph creation pipeline defined in `networkx_graph/create_graph/__init__.py`.

## File Descriptions

These files represent the state of the graph or related data at different stages of the build process:

1.  **`stage1_networkx_graph_hubs_base.json`**
    *   **Generated by**: `build_hub_graph.py` (Step 1)
    *   **Content**: The initial base graph containing hub nodes and unweighted edges representing direct line connections between hubs.

2.  **`stage2_networkx_graph_hubs_with_transfers.json`**
    *   **Generated by**: `add_proximity_transfers.py` (Step 2)
    *   **Content**: The base graph with potential walking transfer edges added between nearby hubs. These transfer edges are initially unweighted.

3.  **`inter_hub_transfers_to_weight.json`**
    *   **Generated by**: `add_proximity_transfers.py` (Step 3)
    *   **Content**: A list of the specific inter-hub transfer connections (source hub, target hub) identified in Step 2 that require weight calculation.

4.  **`stage3_networkx_graph_hubs_with_transfer_weights.json`**
    *   **Generated by**: `calculate_transfer_weights.py` (Step 4)
    *   **Content**: The graph from stage 2, but with the walking time weights calculated and added to the transfer edges.

5.  **`stage4_calculated_hub_edge_weights.json`**
    *   **Generated by**: `get_tube_dlr_edge_weights.py` (Step 5) and `get_overground_Elizabeth_edge_weights.py` (Step 6)
    *   **Content**: A consolidated JSON list containing the calculated journey time weights for all Tube, DLR, Overground, and Elizabeth Line edges between hubs. This file does *not* represent the graph structure itself, only the weights to be applied.

6.  **`final_networkx_graph.json`**
    *   **Generated by**: `update_graph_weights.py` (Step 7, after validation in Step 6.5)
    *   **Content**: The final, fully weighted graph. This incorporates the weighted transfer edges from stage 3 and applies the line segment weights from stage 4 to the corresponding edges in the graph.

**Note**: These files are intermediate outputs. The primary result of the pipeline is `final_networkx_graph.json`.
