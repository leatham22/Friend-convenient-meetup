# Graph Analysis

This directory contains scripts and utilities for analysing and validating the final London transport NetworkX graph generated by the `create_graph` pipeline.

## Contents

-   **`validate_final_graph.py`**: This script performs various checks on the final graph file (`final_networkx_graph.json`) to ensure its integrity and consistency. It might check for:
    *   Missing nodes or edges.
    *   Edges with invalid or missing weights.
    *   Connectivity issues.
    *   Consistency between node attributes and edge attributes (e.g., modes).
-   **`graph_utils.py`**: A utility module likely containing helper functions used by the analysis scripts (and potentially other parts of the project). These functions could relate to graph loading, node/edge querying, weight calculations, or other common graph operations.

## Usage

Scripts in this directory are typically run *after* the main graph has been built using `python build_graph.py`. They take the final graph file as input for their analysis.

For example, to run the validation script (assuming it takes the standard graph path):

```bash
python networkx_graph/analyse_graph/validate_final_graph.py 
```

Consult the individual scripts for specific usage instructions or required arguments.
