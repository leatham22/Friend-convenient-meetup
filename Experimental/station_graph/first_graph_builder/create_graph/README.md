### Graph Building Scripts
**`old_build_networkx_graph.py`**
- **Original Purpose**: An earlier iteration of graph building using line coordinates, likely superseded by `build_networkx_graph.py` within this folder before the final `network_data` approach.
- **Key Issue**: Used complex coordinate-matching which led to incorrect connections.
- **Replaced By**: `networkx_graph/create_graph/build_networkx_graph_new.py` using `Route/Sequence` Data
